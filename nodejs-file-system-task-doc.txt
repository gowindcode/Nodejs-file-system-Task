Dear FSD Team, 

Please note in this task we have successfully created .txt file with file name as current timestamp.
And in side the file messgae including current timestamp.
And each new file will automatically store in files folder.
All required packages installed in package.json
And for auto server kick start after changes in index.js we have installed nodemon. 
So initialy we need to kick start server using "npm run dev"
after that every time we save the index.js it will automatically kick start the server,
Until add new files, packages.

And we have used gitignore for node_modules.

Aswell we have checked with postman to getting files and screen shot attached in git repository.

so once to get all files in postman. 
using http://localhost:5000/files

And we can create new txt file from postman and delete particular txt file from postman.
using http://localhost:5000/files we can create new txt file

and delete the particular file from files folder using postman like below
http://localhost:5000/files/28-1-2024_4-08-11 pm.txt

please note the file name must including type and exactly same all cjharacters spaces.

If suppose we will going to install anyother package, we should stop server using ctrl+c then enter "y" then enter to terminate the server link.

After made all the changes, we will restart the server using "npm run dev" command on terminal

thank you for reading this message, and seeing the files, codes.
